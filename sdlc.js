// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirments
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirments = "Through thorough research, this next step outlines everything from user experience goals to database structure requirements for your product."

const design = "Designing mockups so that everyone involved knows exactly how their role will cohesively fit as a team moving forward "

const implementation = "The writing and execution of the code"

const testingAndIntegration = `Prior to any launch date, it's imperative to test the written code to ensure no major bugs or erros plague the software once it is in the hands of consumer`

const Maintain = `You aren't done once you have successfully released the software. Once in the hands of consumers, bugs may arise and it's critical to update the existing software product to fix bugs and ensure reliabilty.`
